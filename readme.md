## Version 1

22-8-2018 - First commit for frontend and wrapper 

23-8-2018 - As of currently unfortunately we are still waiting for twitter to approve my developer account so I may get access to the API to do the actual lifting and formating of the results. Please check back later this week or let me know if it is not needed anymore. More information https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-clamps-down-on-developer-access-to-apis/ 

## Installation and usage

Just clone the repository, rehost the script file on the server, run composer update to get the twitter wrapper and you are good to go. Package contains two PHP scripts, one readme, one JS script and a composer dependency file.

```composer update```

a demo is hosted here
