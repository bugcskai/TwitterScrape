## Version 1

23-8-201 - As of currently unfortunately we are still waiting for twitter to approve my developer account so I may get access to the API to do the actual lifting. Please check back later this week.

## About the Twitter API Scrapper

This simple tool is built on PHP using bootstrap quickstart template and a Twitter PHP API Wrapper by J7mbo, sources below:

## Installation and usage

Just clone the repository, rehost the script file on the server, run composer update to get the twitter wrapper and you are good to go. Package contains two PHP scripts, one readme, one JS script and a composer dependency file.
